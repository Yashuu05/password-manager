# 🔐 Password Manager

This **Password Manager** is a simple yet powerful GUI-based Python application built using **Tkinter**.  
It is part of my **learning journey** to explore Python, GUI programming, and file handling.  
The tool allows users to generate strong passwords, save them securely to a CSV file, and manage them easily with options to delete or copy.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Generate Password**: Instantly generate strong random passwords.
- 💾 **Save Password**: Save app name, username, and generated password to a local CSV file.
- 🧹 **Clear Fields**: Clear all input fields with a single click.
- ❌ **Delete Data**: Permanently delete all saved passwords from the CSV file.
- 📋 **Copy Password**: Quickly copy the generated password to clipboard for easy use.
